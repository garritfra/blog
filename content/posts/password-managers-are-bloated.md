Nowadays, password managers are a necessity if you care even a slightest about your personal belongings on the interwebs. But think about it, do you really want to trust another company to store your most sensible information?

##### TL;DR

Use a **stateless** password manager like [LessPass](https://lesspass.com/) to access your password without relying on a third party to store your data.

### Why use a password manager in the first place?

Having a single password for multiple accounts is convenient. What's also convenient, is **using** this password on multiple accounts once you have access to a single one. What might be convenient to you, might also me convenient to others. Many people, [especially celebrities](https://web.archive.org/web/20170225163642/http://uk.businessinsider.com/twitter-says-it-wasnt-hacked-passwords-reused-older-hacks-malware-to-blame-2016-6), fall victim to this trap of comfort.

To counteract this, people are (and should be) using different passwords for different accounts. These passwords differ in a single letter or digit (Twitter: `porridge4president`, GitHub: `poridge5president`, etc.), or they don't match at all (Twitter: `porridge4president`, GitHub: `YouWontGuessThisOne`).

The problem that most likely arises from this technique is called _password chaos_ ([Source](https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/password+chaos)):

> _"The confusion that arises when users have many unique passwords."_

The aim of a password manager is [to solve this problem by storing all of your passwords in a single place and securing it with an _ultra secure superpassword!_ (©)](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-use-password-manager-store-protect-yourself-hackers-lastpass-1password-dashlane-2017-2?r=DE&IR=T#most-people-are-bad-at-passwords-real-bad-1). This way, you can use arbitrary passwords - preferebly gibberish that doesn't make sense to humans (nor machines) - without losing them, as long as you have your _ultra secure superpassword!_ (©) - aka your masterpassword. The benefits are obvious: You get rid of the password chaos problem while staying relatively secure. Eventhough password managers are quite benificial, some people (including myself) see a catch in them.

### Relying on a third party

Relying on third party companies doesn't seem like a big deal. After all, you are probably using some form of cloud service to host your photos. Yet there's a lot of trust involved in letting others handle your private data, especially your passwords. In 2017, [a major password manager got hacked, exposing sensitive data including users and their passwords](https://www.zdnet.com/article/onelogin-hit-by-data-breached-exposing-sensitive-customer-data/). This shows the potential for security breaches in an application that inherently seemed safe.
